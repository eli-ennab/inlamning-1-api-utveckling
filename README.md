# Submission task 1 in the course API-development, Medieinstitutet
## Individual school project in the course API-development.
The submission task was to create a simple backend to our previous front end submission task Bortakväll. I created the database using TypeScript and Prisma, and tested the database both in Postman and towards the Bortakväll-URL for creating and reading products and orders.
